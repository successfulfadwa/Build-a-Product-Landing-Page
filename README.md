# Product Landing Page

This is a responsive product landing page that meets the following user stories:

- As a user, I can view a product landing page with a header section that contains a logo, a navigation menu, and an embedded product video.
- As a user, I can navigate to different sections of the landing page by clicking the corresponding links in the navigation menu.
- As a user, I can enter my email address in a form input field and submit it to receive more information about the product.
- As a user, I can view the landing page on different devices and screen sizes, with the layout and content adapting accordingly.
- As a developer, I can see how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to build a modern and visually appealing web page, featuring flexbox and media queries.
